# BRCA1-Structura-A-Homology-Modeling-Insight-into-Tumor-Suppressor-Architecture
 BRCA1 is a key tumor suppressor involved in DNA repair. Mutations in BRCA1 are linked to breast and ovarian cancer. Homology modeling helps predict its 3D structure, enabling insights into functional domains and guiding mutation analysis and targeted drug discovery.
